# AdaptiveAutoLayout

A sample project demonstrating the Offscreen Layout technique, as introduced in my Adaptive Auto Layout talk:
* [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taWaW2GzfCI) (relevant portion begins at [51m:39s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taWaW2GzfCI&t=51m39s))
* [PDF slides](http://cl.ly/3D332n1l3O1s)

Because this project uses CocoaPods to consume [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout), you must open the `AdaptiveAutoLayout.xcworkspace` file in Xcode to build and run the project.
